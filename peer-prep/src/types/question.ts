  shortDescription: `Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.  
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.`,
  description: `Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.  
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
  
Example 1: 
  
Input: s = 
["h","e","l","l","o"] 
Output: 
["o","l","l","e","h"] 
Example 2: 
  
Input: s = 
["H","a","n","n","a","h"] 
Output: 
["h","a","n","n","a","H"] 
  
Constraints: 
  
1 <= s.length <= 105 
s[i] is a printable ascii character. `,
